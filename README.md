# Version controlled configuration files

Installation:

    cd ~
    git clone git://github.com/chbrown/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
    cd .dotfiles
    ./INSTALL

You can also run `./INSTALL --help` to see a few options.

These files / directories are currently symlinked:

    .ackrc
    .bash_logout
    .bash_profile
    .bashrc
    .gemrc
    .gitconfig
    .gitignore_global
    .inputrc
    .screenrc
    .tmux.conf
    .vim/
    .vimrc

`./INSTALL` will also create a file, `~/.localrc`, which should contain any sensitive credentials or machine-specific settings.

These config settings are intended to be agnostic or adaptive between Mac OS X, Arch Linux, and Ubuntu.


## Mac OS X system settings

`/etc/paths` should look something like this:

    /usr/sbin
    /usr/bin
    /sbin
    /bin

These are loaded into the PATH variable, separated by colons.

`/etc/path.d/*` might also have some things. These are put after the contents of `/etc/paths`.

This repository also provides a [`new_mac.sh`](new_mac.sh) script that helps configure an OS X install with reasonable defaults.
It does a few things:

* `chown`'s the system Python site-packages to the current user
* installs some basic useful packages with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* Uses `defaults` to remove many animations, disable a few warnings, overall making OS X more expert-friendly
